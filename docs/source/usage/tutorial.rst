Introduction to CCOBRA
----------------------

CCOBRA's philosophy is based around the fact that models always attempt to solve
specific modeling tasks, either explicitly or implicitly. Contrary to big parts
of the current state of the art in cognitive modeling, CCOBRA focuses on making
the processes underlying response generation explicit. To this end, CCOBRA
mandates models to revolve around a single method ``predict(...)`` which asks
for a single prediction in response to a presented problem.

In syllogistic reasoning, a toy model might be constructed in a way that it is
always supposed to respond with *No valid response* indicating that no logical
inference can be drawn in response to the given task. Consequently, its
``predict`` method will always return ``[[NVC]]``.

The sheer simplicity of CCOBRA sets it apart from most contemporary modeling
approaches. Models are not required to adhere to rigorous Bayesian fundamentals
nor computational logic calculi nor statistical effects extracted from years
of psychological research. Instead, it encourages tackling core problems of
cognitive science by imposing little to no constraints with respect to the
computational foundation of model instances. The sole requirement is the
ability to make predictions in response to tasks, an arguably trivial
prerequisite.

CCOBRA heralds the dawn of a new paradigm of cognitive modeling -- a perspective
that is focused on prediction-based performance. Coupling the goal of achieving
high predictive performance with rich possibilities to infer insight into
the computational principles underlying model implementations, CCOBRA offers
a modern toolset to aid computer scientists and cognitive scientists alike in
their respective goals.

Structure of the Package
------------------------

The general structure of the CCOBRA package is to be considered unstable and
non-final due to the relative youth of the project.

Currently, the package contents are structured as followed:

- ``ccobra``: The root namespace contains base classes and interfaces.
- ``ccobra.syllogistic``: Syllogistic helper classes and functions.

Developing a first Model
------------------------

Implementing models for CCOBRA is as easy as completing the following template
from which only the ``predict`` method is mandatory:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import ccobra

    class MyModel(ccobra.CCobraModel):
        def __init__(self, name='MyModel'):
            """ Model constructor.

            """

            # Call the super constructor to fully initialize the model
            supported_domains = ['syllogistic']
            supported_response_types = ['single-choice']
            super(MyModel, self).__init__(
                name, supported_domains, supported_response_types)

            ...

        def start_participant(self, **kwargs):
            """ Model initialization method. Used to setup the initial state of
            its datastructures, memory, etc.

            """
            ...

        def pre_train(self, dataset):
            """ Pre-trains the model based on one or more datasets.

            """
            ...

        def predict(self, item, **kwargs):
            """ Predicts weighted responses to a given problem.

            """
            ...

        def adapt(self, item, target, **kwargs):
            """ Trains the model based on a given problem-target combination.

            """
            ...

The goal of this section is to develop a simple toy model in the domain of
syllogistic reasoning that responds with *No Valid Conclusion* to all tasks.
This can be achieved by writing the following lines of code:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import ccobra

    class NVCModel(ccobra.CCobraModel):
        def __init__(self, name='NVCModel'):
            super(NVCModel, self).__init__(
                name, ['syllogistic'], ['single-choice'])

        def predict(self, item, **kwargs):
            return [['NVC']]

The ``__init__`` method calls the super constructor providing it with
information about the domain and response-type the model is capable of handling
as well as its name which is used for referencing results. Due to its static
nature, ``predict`` always returns *No Valid Response*.

The remainder of the functions do not need to be specified.

Evaluating the Model
--------------------

CCOBRA's model evaluation revolves around defining benchmarks based on training
and test data as well as baseline models. Predefined benchmarks can be found
in the ``ccobra-bench`` directory in the repository. Benchmarks are defined
as JSON files adhering to the following structure:

.. code-block:: json
    :linenos:

    {
        "data.train": "path/to/train_data.csv",
        "data.test": "path/to/test_data.csv",
        "models": [
            "path/to/model1.py",
            "path/to/model2.py",
            "path/to/model3.py"
        ]
    }

Benchmarks can be modified by changing the respective lines. Note, that paths
are considered relative to the location of the benchmark file itself. Assuming
the JSON file to be located at ``~/benchmarks/benchmark.json``, the first model
would refer to the file ``~/benchmarks/path/to/model1.py``.

After installing CCOBRA, a command line program ``ccobra`` is registered. Benchmarks
are run by calling this program and supplying the json configuration file (alternatively
you can use ``ccobra`` executable found in the ``benchmarks`` directory of the repository):

    .. code::

        $> ccobra /path/to/benchmark.json

To evaluate a model against a benchmark, the ``-m`` flag is used:

    .. code::

        $> ccobra /path/to/benchmark.json -m /path/to/model.py

In this case, the additional model does not need to be integrated into the
benchmark file.
